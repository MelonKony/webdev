#### Personality

There are a lot of things Tzipora does differently to everybody else, and they start to make a lot more sense when you realise Tzipora either does not *realise* she is unusual, or does not *care*.

She has a lot of endearing characteristics that give great character to her mannerisms and physicality. She has a small overbite that makes her look a little froggy, and ritually pulls on her shirt and wipes her nose in anxious conversation. She is round-headed and cuts her hair herself. She talks in a low, expressive voice. She has been poorly socialised in childhood, and is afraid of casual conversation with people she does not know. She is keenly socially attuned and feels awkwardness painfully.

She wears the same clothes two or three days in a row. The outfits themselves are variations of the same thing, and her tastes don‚Äôt change. Everything hangs off her ‚Äî she likes baggy, airy clothing, and upsizes to accomodate. She doesn‚Äôt like fashionable or voguish people, whom she regards as decadent and offensive. To Tzipora, taste is timeless and bound to the soul. In her case, this fact has held true ‚Äî she has dressed the same as childhood, and very little else has changed about her in that time.

She is paranoid and conservative, good-natured and austere, with a moral outlook bound by her deepest anxieties and obsessions. She is deeply spiritual and material, fascinated with objects and their history. She has many collections of many things she‚Äôs found. She‚Äôll likely die a Catholic, but has a confrontational relationship with God and no longer attends mass, as a declaration of humanism. She does not know if this has pissed Him off, but it‚Äôs working out so far. Maybe that‚Äôs why He made her a homosexual ‚Äî to get back at her. He must have a good sense of humour, if that‚Äôs the case.

Tzipora may be intense and inward-facing, but she can also be disarmingly charming and self-deprecating. She has a good sense of humour. There are not many girls that can so easily reconcile the contradictions between the peculiar and the healthy, the eccentric and the friendly, and the violent and the domestic. That‚Äôs part of her character ‚Äî an essence of being that radiates decency, good taste and a respect for the spirit of all things.

### 2.2 üå≥ Cobian Queismesnah

**Cobian lo Ro de Viviya de Queismesnah** is Tzipora's longtime friend and occasional girlfriend. Conservative in manner and appearance, Cobian is easily remembered by her circular spectacles and stern fringe, styles maintained since childhood. Tzipora and Cobian met during secondary schooling and young adulthood in Vekllei, and remained close throughout the rest of their lives. She is very close with Tzipora, but has tepid relationships with Tzipora's mostly male friendship group out of jealousy and a general distaste for boys.

#### Personality

When Tzipora meets her, Cobian is a figure of sympathy and annoyance. Cobian was deeply insecure and had constructed an elaborate character for herself which she acted out each day at school, convincing no-one and isolating her after friendships shifted in the tumultuous transition between middle and secondary schooling.
