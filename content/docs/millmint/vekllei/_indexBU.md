## 1. Overview

<div id="intro">
<b>Vekllei</b> is the utopian landscape of Hobart's ongoing Petticoat Project. Set ostensibly in Iceland, the society and geography of this country is radically different from our own, and explores new systems of living through a flexible alternate history.
</div>

<span class="fc">V</span>
**ekllei** (also ***The Kingdom of Vekllei***, ***The Vekllei Commonwealth***, ***Islandi***, ***Iceland***) is a sovereign island country situated in the northern Atlantic, between Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Besides the 100 boroughs of the conterminous Vekllei city-state (referred to as the **Home Island** or **Crown Metropole**), Vekllei includes two autonomous territories, six crown territories and various possessions including over a hundred satellite islands and islets. It is the 14th most densely-populated country in the world, with a population of 24.4 millions mostly situated around the Capital Region in the south-west of the Home Island. Its capital and largest city is Vekllei in the Capital Region, which is home to two-thirds of the total population. The interior plateau of the Home Island consists of sand and lava fields, flower-tundras, glaciers, and temperate rainforests, and its lowlands are home to many glacial rivers.

The Home Island has been inhabited for at least four thousand years by Arctic peoples migrating from Kalalist (Greenland). Evidence of European settlement in Vekllei can be established from unearthed fishing towns dated to 1230BC, when settlers from Ireland established fishing communities along the southern coast. Subsequent centuries saw rapid growth of the local population, which was politically and culturally isolated from mainland Europe by the 6th Century BC. By the 4th Century BC, many contemporary cultural features of the country had become commonplace, including an early form of [Upen](docs/millmint/vekllei/religion) and [Vekllei logographs](/docs/millmint/vekllei/language/#22--topet). During the following millennia Vekllei develop into a major Atlantic economic and military power, but saw its influence decline between the 12th and 15th Centuries AD during the [Period of Rest](?).

During Vekllei's [Middle Period](?), the country was struck by civil unrest that escalated into civil war, which installed the Aismo Desimou as the first King of Vekllei. The monarchy succeeded until Vekllei's colonial [Late Period](/), which fell to a navy coup d'etat that installed a military junta in government, which rapidly expanded Vekllei's colonial holdings. This practice would continue well into the 20th Century, and would spark the [Africa Wars](/) and [Vekllei's atomic bombing by the United Kingdom](?) in 2005, which collapsed the existing regime and ushered in British occupation of the country.

Since independence in 2015, Vekllei's [Floral Period](?) has transformed the country, and has been marked by a period of tremendous stability and economic growth. Vekllei does not use money domestically, with most internal trade dependent on social exchange, barter and state service, but operates twin currencies (the *Government* and *Vekllei* Crown) in its trade internationally. Vekllei is a great power and has the world's fifth highest military expenditure. The country is highly developed and has exceptional liveability, and is placed highly in key social indicators: education, healthcare, quality of life, personal safety and housing, with a home-ownership rate of nearly 96%. It is a member of the United Nations' Non-Aligned Concern League. Since independence, Vekllei has maintained a strong position of armed neutrality, and is home to many international organisations, including the new United Nations Office, the International Federation of Journalists and the Universal Post Union. Immigrants account for 30% of the population, and multiracialism is enshrined in the constitution, and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics.

### Introduction

## 2. Etymology

<span class="fc">T</span>
he word *Vekllei* comes from the Islandi-Quutetast fusion dialect called *Topyas* ('Old Vekllei' in English), which was in common use by the 1st Century AD. It comes from the *Topyas* words for "Volcanic town," or *Vek*, and "sea under the stars," or *Lei*, meaning "town of the stars by the sea". According to sagas, the name was gifted to the country by a volcanic spirit-god called *Tipet* (most likely present-day *Kesmi*) in the 3rd Century, but was likely a feature of Queen Souisviasn's language reforms during that time.

The word "Vekllei" refers to both the country and the island, and is also pluralised.

Vekllei was first known as *Islandi*, or "Land of Ice" in an extinct Indo-European language documented under the same name in early sagas, but is likely at least partially derived from Algic-Aleutian *Quutetast* word for "snow," *Ismo*. Sagas award Faroese settler Ann Sigfúsdottir with the island's discovery and name, though little else is known of her.  

## 3. History

<div id="intro">
<b>Vekllei</b> is an ancient country even by metrics of human settlement. There is evidence of human settlement in the Home Islands from 6,000 years ago, which predates European settlement by nearly 4,000 years.

## 4. Geography

Vekllei sits atop the constructive boundary of the Mid-Atlantic ridge, bridging the North American and the Eurasian tectonic plates. The country is also situated between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, although the entirety of the Home Island is situated beneath the arctic circle. Despite this, the extreme latitude of inhabited areas means daylight is highly seasonal in the county, with dark winters and summer solstices that provide 23 consecutive hours of daylight.

The unstable Atlantic pressure oscillation, of which Vekllei anchors as the Vekllei Low Pole, can pull in bitter cold from the Greenland currents, or warmth from the Azores tempestuously. This gifts the Home Islands a temperate climate, with average temperatures in summer of about 18-25 degrees centigrade that decline into an annual mean low of approximately 10 degrees in the Capital Region. The good weather and seasonal daylight inform Vekllei's animistic spiritualism, with festivals to mark both solstices.

Vekllei sits between North American and Continental European territories, but is usually regarded as independent of both because of its central position in the North Atlantic and its peripheral posessions, which include Kalalist and the Faroe Islands.

Vekllei is the world's 18th largest island, and

## 6. Economy

<div id="intro">
<b>Vekllei</b> is land of plenty and small pleasures, afforded by a post-scarcity system that positions competing systems against each other. It is made up of a startling series of contradictions -- one after the other, each more unusual than the last. Vekllei is a planned economy; it is also a free market. Property ownership is obfuscated by portioned sovereignty of land and product. Decommodification has devalued products in a country based on manufacturing. There are many contradictions, inefficiencies and unusual mechanisms in the Vekllei domestic market, which total to benefit the living conditions of the average person.
</div>

<span class="fc">A</span>
lthough a major power, Vekllei has an unusual hybrid market system called the *Bureau System* (known colloquially as *Petticoat Socialism*), which uses both state-owned and socialist centralism to benefit a free market. Most unique about the Vekllei economy is its domestic moneylessness, in which domestic society has abolished currency. Trade and materials are provided by Helter-style robotics infrastructure and participatory work, and is supplemented in places by mandatory military service. Vekllei people enjoy a high standard of living and access to most consumer goods.

Postwar Vekllei economics champions free association, home-ownership and informal markets. Although microeconomically Vekllei is highly liberalised, most essential goods of the country are produced in vertically integrated in labour-union *Bureaus*, which, although representative of private companies and independent from the government, are associated with the general political processes of the country.  

*Bureaus* are trade unions that organise business in the country, and the largest of them include thousands of individual companies and concerns. Companies are generally cooperative enterprises in Vekllei, and so worker votes are consolidated into "Company Ballots" used to influence political affairs within a *Bureau* and the country at large.

Although moneyless domestically, the nation maintains two currencies, known as the *Vekllei Crown* and the *Government Crown* for foreign trade.

- **The Vekllei Crown** is representative of Vekllei's export-import mechanism known as the *International Market*. It is gold-backed, and represents the bullion value of the Market. Since the *International Market* is completely closed and independent of the domestic economy, its value is controlled directly by the so-called Government Bank. It is one of the few gold-backed currencies in a developed nation today.
- **The Government Crown** is not minted and used only as an investment mechanism, backed by government “white bonds” which are usually measures of labour-hours or refined materials. It is, in a sense, a fiat currency alongside a gold-backed currency.

Both currencies are used for trade internationally, and float on the labour-power of the domestic economy. The Vekllei Crown is minted as a novelty, but otherwise no money is printed in the country, since Government Crowns are essentially labour-backed state bonds. Moneyless benefits citizens in many ways, as Vekllei people do not typically maintain debts, enjoy unlimited *Petty Commodities*, and enjoy some of the shortest workdays and working weeks in the world, with all citizens afforded two month's holiday each year.

### Employment

Vekllei has a high unemployment rate for a developed country, reported at 12.5%. About 80% of Vekllei workers belong to a trade union, usually *Pettiburos* or *Bureaus*. Nearly 2 million Vekllei people are enrolled in higher education full-time, significantly reducing the nation's labour pool. These are accounted for politically as natural fluctuations of the deregulated Bureau System, and unemployment in the country has seen a stable reduction since the initial decades of independence. Although many citizens in Vekllei are immigrants, the country has few foreign workers, and those employed in the country tend to be high-skill and high-wage workers.

Since no work is compensated by money in the country, international standard metrics for poverty and income per capita are obfuscated. It is generally understood that urban populations have easier access to consumer goods, but inferior access to local produce and genuine meat products. Rural populations are also more likely to take on informal work in their village or town, and may not necessarily hold membership in an industry bureau.

### Industry

Vekllei's sovereign wealth fund, the Government Securities Bureau, is the largest such fund in the world with commodity and non-commodity holdings totalling over VK12 trillion. It is the primary investment mechanism of the Vekllei state and has generated controversy and outrage of its economic power and political presence abroad. Vekllei is the second-largest logistics hub in the world, largest   

Vekllei primarily exports manufactured goods, which are produced by both human and automatic labour via commodity imports and extraterrestrial materials mining.

Vekllei maintains a Goods and Services Tax (GST) on all foreign business in the country of approx. 10%.

Vekllei's Dohyo Free Port is the largest in the Atlantic and among the busiest in the world. Most of Vekllei's liquid currency assets, denominated as Government Kroner, are

### Tourism

Tourism is a major source of foreign income in Vekllei, and the country attracts some 6 million tourists annually. Although the number of tourists is low compared to popular destinations in North America and Europe, Vekllei's strict entry requirements and state monopoly on hotels and tourist infrastructure means that most visitors are high-spending business travellers or wealthy foreigners, which contribute around 0.5% of the country's GDP annually.

## 7. Demographics

Vekllei has one of the highest population densities in the world, skewed largely by the populous Capital Region. Vekllei considers itself a city-state, and to this end fosters some

Vekllei is experiencing a slight demographic trend towards an older population, and the average age of the country stands at 35 years old.

Vekllei maintains a stable fertility rate of about 1.9 children per woman, indicating a slight decline in population. Vekllei enjoys high rates of immigration, sponsored by the government, largely from Western and Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, South-East Asia and South America.
