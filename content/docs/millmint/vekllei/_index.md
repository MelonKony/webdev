## 1. Overview

<div id="intro">
<b>Vekllei</b> is the utopian landscape of Hobart's ongoing Petticoat Project. Set ostensibly in Iceland, the society and geography of this country is radically different from our own, and explores new systems of living through a flexible alternate history.

**ekllei** (also ***The Kingdom of Vekllei***, ***The Vekllei Commonwealth***, ***Islandi***, ***Iceland***) is a sovereign island country situated in the northern Atlantic, between Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Besides the 100 boroughs of the conterminous Vekllei city-state (referred to as the **Home Island** or **Crown Metropole**), Vekllei includes two autonomous territories, six crown territories and various possessions including over a hundred satellite islands and islets. It is the 14th most densely-populated country in the world, with a population of 24.4 millions mostly situated around the Capital Region in the south-west of the Home Island. Its capital and largest city is Vekllei in the Capital Region, which is home to two-thirds of the total population. The interior plateau of the Home Island consists of sand and lava fields, flower-tundras, glaciers, and temperate rainforests, and its lowlands are home to many glacial rivers.

The Home Island has been inhabited for at least four thousand years by Arctic peoples migrating from Kalalist (Greenland). Evidence of European settlement in Vekllei can be established from unearthed fishing towns dated to 1230BC, when settlers from Ireland established fishing communities along the southern coast. Subsequent centuries saw rapid growth of the local population, which was politically and culturally isolated from mainland Europe by the 6th Century BC. By the 4th Century BC, many contemporary cultural features of the country had become commonplace, including an early form of [Upen](docs/millmint/vekllei/religion) and [Vekllei logographs](/docs/millmint/vekllei/language/#22--topet). During the following millennia Vekllei develop into a major Atlantic economic and military power, but saw its influence decline between the 12th and 15th Centuries AD during the [Period of Rest](?).

During Vekllei's [Middle Period](?), the country was struck by civil unrest that escalated into civil war, which installed the Aismo Desimou as the first King of Vekllei. The monarchy succeeded until Vekllei's colonial [Late Period](/), which fell to a navy coup d'etat that installed a military junta in government, which rapidly expanded Vekllei's colonial holdings. This practice would continue well into the 20th Century, and would spark the [Africa Wars](/) and [Vekllei's atomic bombing by the United Kingdom](?) in 2005, which collapsed the existing regime and ushered in British occupation of the country.

Since independence in 2015, Vekllei's [Floral Period](?) has transformed the country, and has been marked by a period of tremendous stability and economic growth. Vekllei does not use money domestically, with most internal trade dependent on social exchange, barter and state service, but operates twin currencies (the *Government* and *Vekllei* Crown) in its trade internationally. Vekllei is a great power and has the world's fifth highest military expenditure. The country is highly developed and has exceptional liveability, and is placed highly in key social indicators: education, healthcare, quality of life, personal safety and housing, with a home-ownership rate of nearly 96%. It is a member of the United Nations' Non-Aligned Concern League. Since independence, Vekllei has maintained a strong position of armed neutrality, and is home to many international organisations, including the new United Nations Office, the International Federation of Journalists and the Universal Post Union. Immigrants account for 30% of the population, and multiracialism is enshrined in the constitution, and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics.
