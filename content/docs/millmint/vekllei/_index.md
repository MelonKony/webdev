![bulletin](/images/railmap.jpg)

**Vekllei** (also *The Kingdom of Vekllei*, *The Vekllei Commonwealth*, *Islanda*, *Iceland*) is a sovereign island country situated in the northern Atlantic, between Greenland and the Faroe Islands. It consists of the Vekllei city-state (referred to as the Home Island or Crown Metropole), two autonomous territories, six crown territories and various possessions including over a hundred satellite islands and islets. It is the 14th most densely-populated country in the world, with a population of 24.4 millions mostly situated around the Capital Region in the south-west of the Home Island. Its capital and largest city is Vekllei in the Capital Region, which is home to two-thirds of the total population. The interior plateau of the Home Island consists of sand and lava fields, flower-tundras, glaciers, and temperate rainforests, and its lowlands are home to many glacial rivers.
