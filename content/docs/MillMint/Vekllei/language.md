# üìú Language in Vekllei
## 1. Introduction

**Vekllei language**, abbreviated to just **Vekllei**, has six core sublanguages that are used commonly today. Although they often intersect, these different systems of communication are distinct languages in their own right, used for different purposes in different arenas of communication.

{{< details title="Language Systems in Vekllei" open=true >}}
1. **Spoken Vekllei**, which is everyday spoken language. It draws from two glossaries with different meanings and feelings, called *Oa* and *Loh*.
2. **Topet**, which are logographic characters (occasionally characterised as hieroglyphs). Like other pictographic languages, *Topet* characters can be broken down into repeating components, called *Topotte*.
3. **Rapotenne**, is the traditional logographic language of names. It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography.
4. **Potenne**, lit. ‚Äú*Hand-Talk*‚Äù, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it.
5. **Upotenne**, lit. ‚Äú*Spirit-Hand-Talk*‚Äù, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual.
6. **Vekllei Semaphore** is the codification of colour and shape. Traditionally limited to colour, shape and pattern are now also included in *Vekllei Semaphore*, in which full sentences can be formed.

## 2. Language

Let's take a look in more detail about how each aspect of the Vekllei language operates in daily life. With six recognised language, Vekllei is unique in its complexity and multidimensionality, appropriating a variety of scripts, glossaries, alphabets and physical components. Literacy in the country is very high, and [*Spoken Vekllei*](/docs/MillMint/Vekllei/language/#21-spoken-vekllei) and [*Topet*](/docs/MillMint/Vekllei/language/#22-topet) are understood universally. Other languages, often called *sub-languages*, are informed regionally and have varying literacy across the Home Island. For example, [*Upotenne*](/docs/MillMint/Vekllei/language/#25-upotenne) is employed frequently in rural and agrarian communities, where religious ritual requires its frequent practice. This passage introduces the broad characteristics of each sub-language, which together form contemporary Vekllei, one of the world's most complex and hermetic language systems.

### 2.1 Spoken Vekllei

**Spoken Vekllei**, simply referred to as Vekllei domestically, is the common spoken language of Vekllei and official language of the country, spoken by some 25 million people worldwide, with 98% of speakers living natively in the Vekllei Home Islands. It is the first spoken language of the vast majority of the population, and has minor variance across the disparate Vekllei Home Islands and other Vekllei possessions. It is rarely spoken outside of Vekllei territories, extant only through emigrant populations and small diasporic communities mostly dispersed after the Atomic War.

#### 2.2.1 Overview

Contemporary spoken Vekllei is largely descended from *Proto-Islandi* speech that arrived with the first Danish settlers in the country, but includes *Kalaallisut* and Proto-Algic reconstructions of an early extinct language called *Kala*. Modern spoken Vekllei has heritage in the combined, largely extinct language hybrid of Algic-Aleutian *Quutetast* and the Indo-European *Islandi,* which by the 9th century had fused into common speech usually called *Topyas*, or 'Old Speech'/'Old Vekllei'. Modern Vekllei has evolved distinctively since the Atomic War as part of broader sociological trends towards informalised speech and cultivated *Loh* vocabularies.

#### 2.2.2 Twin Glossaries

Spoken Vekllei draws from two glossaries, called *Oa* and *Loh*. These glossaries date back to twin reconstructed Algic-Aleutian languages called *Quutetast* and *Islandi* that had been present in earlier forms since at least 1200BC. The glossaries were formalised in pagan ritual that would become present-day [*Upen*](docs/millmint/vekllei/religion.md), and later recognised as the official language of the country in the reformation initiated by Queen Souisviasn in the 3rd century.

- ##### Oa (*lit.* Sun)
  *Oa* is considered to have 'permanent' traits. It is often characterised abroad as a positive glossary, though this is not true -- it is in fact dedicated to inanimate and unliving organs. It is gendered as masculine, and is associated with Summer and Spring.
- ##### Loh (*lit.* Moon)
  *Loh* is considered to have 'cyclical' traits. Loh words are largely derived from Old Vekllei (including Icelandic), and so its glossary is considerably less defined and dependent on older linguistic artefacts. *Loh* words
 It is gendered as feminine, and is associated with winter and autumn.

 In modernity, this binary produces bizarre psycholinguistic quirks. For example, a sailing vessel (*Siv*) is derived from the *Oa*, historically because the *Oa* glossary was favoured for machines between the 10th and 16th Centuries. This genders all modern oceangoing vessels as male figures to this day, and due to *Siv*'s linguistic derivatives, ties ships permanently to the lumber and woodlands critical to wooden shipbuilding. From the 20th century onwards, however, most vehicles are regarded impermanent through *Loh*, and so all cars in Vekllei are female.  

#### 2.2.3 Phonology

Spoken Vekllei is phonologically homogenous, and has little variation in accent or pronunciation across the Home Island or its various possessions.

##### Monophthongs

Pure vowels in Vekllei are characterised by their lax, non-rhotic sound.

##### Diphthongs

From foundational monophthongs, gliding or diphthong vowels are often determined by glossary. *Oa* typically favours modernised post-*Quutetast* glides for its so-called *Ocean Vowels*, which are generally long and unrounded. *Loh* words are typically older and depicted pictographically, and are pronounced as *Floral Vowels*. The tables below list their pronunciation.

### 2.2 Topet


Consonant characters (*demioette*) written in Topet may feature redundant adjacent characters called *phonetic complements*, which, in a non-determinative reading, are pronounced the same way, to guide the reader. This lends to a system that encourages adjacent consonants in some aspects, since Vekllei characters are already combined into neosyllabic pairings and it is immediately obvious which characters are to be read. The word for friend, *comoyia*, can thus sometimes be transliterated into c-c-c<sup>o</sup>m-m<sup>o</sup>y<sup>ia</sup>, which can affect the transcendental meanings of a word through the figurative placement of its characters as well as help guide the reader through the use of multiple phonetically identical, though visually distinct, characters.

### 2.3 Rapotenne

**Rapotenne** (*lit. "Name-Talk"*) is the Vekllei system of names, often considered in modernity to function as a distinct, though limited, language. Contemporary *Rapotenne* is informed by pictographic proto-*Topet* runes as well as elements of the extinct *Kala* language and subsequently *Quutetast* Algic components. Because *Kala* is extinct and *Quutetast* is a dead language, largely displaced by modern spoken Vekllei, *Rapotenne* is unique among Vekllei's sublanguages for its direct lineage from proto-linguistic forms of early Vekllei history, some nearly 4,000 years old. Today it is used largely ceremonially, through ritual related to birth and [Blood Names](**LINK**


### 2.4 Potenne

**Potenne** (*lit. "Hand-Talk"*) is an auxiliary sign language in Vekllei used commonly today as an aid or substitute for vocalised speech. It was originally a form of *avoidance speech* that arose in response to social taboos in [*Upen*](docs/millmint/vekllei/religion.md), but acquired broader use by the 16th century and is employed commonly today part of many conventions and customs within the Home Islands.

#### 2.4.1 Overview

Historic social taboos in Vekllei's dominant religion, Upen, prevented speech between people for a variety of reasons, including for marital, interfamilial, penal and ascetic considerations. *Potenne* first arose to avoid these taboos. During the first substantial immigration of Inuit-Kalaallisut peoples in the 4th century BC, proto-*Potenne* avoidance languages developed pragmatic pidgin forms to allow for trade and communication between settlers and the original Islandi population. This rapid expansion in use saw *Potenne* develop solidified cultural tenants, including phonologically distinct suprasegmental components like *biouspotenne* (*lit. "Face-Talk"*), which distinguishes facial expression from gestures in poetic, transcendental forms, and *kiouyapotenne* (*lit. "Child-Talk"*), which uses facial expressions to teach children individual signs.

By the 11th Century, *Potenne* is documented alongside other critical languages like *Topet*, and had demonstrated its saturation of Vekllei society in several sociological and cultural forms, including [*Upotenne*](/docs/MillMint/Vekllei/language/#25-upotenne), today considered an independent language system within Vekllei's varied linguistic cultures.
