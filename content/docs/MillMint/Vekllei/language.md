# üìú Language in Vekllei
## 1. Introduction

**Vekllei language**, abbreviated to just **Vekllei**, has six core sublanguages that are used commonly today. Although they often intersect, these different systems of communication are distinct languages in their own right, used for different purposes in different arenas of communication.

{{< details title="Language Systems in Vekllei" open=true >}}
1. **Spoken Vekllei**, which is everyday spoken language. It draws from two glossaries with different meanings and feelings, called *Oa* and *Loh*.
2. **Topet**, which are logographic characters (occasionally characterised as hieroglyphs). Like other pictographic languages, *Topet* characters can be broken down into repeating components, called *Topotte*.
3. **Rapotenne**, is the traditional logographic language of names. It is much older than Topet, and has more in common with spiritual runes than modern logography.
4. **Potenne**, lit. ‚Äú*Hand-Talk*‚Äù, is a sign language that incorporates gestures and signing to add meaning to emotion to spoken language, and occasionally in place of it.
5. **Upotenne**, lit. ‚Äú*Spirit-Hand-Talk*‚Äù, as the recreation of runes in human form, used limitedly in spiritual ritual.
6. **Vekllei Semaphore** is the codification of colour and shape. Traditionally limited to colour, shape and pattern are now also included in *Vekllei Semaphore*, in which full sentences can be formed.

## 2. Language

Let's take a look in more detail about how each aspect of the Vekllei language operates in daily life. With six recognised language, Vekllei is unique in its complexity and multidimensionality, appropriating a variety of scripts, glossaries, alphabets and physical components. Literacy in the country is very high, and [*Spoken Vekllei*](/docs/MillMint/Vekllei/language/#21-spoken-vekllei) and [*Topet*](/docs/MillMint/Vekllei/language/#22-topet) are understood universally. Other languages, often called *sub-languages*, are informed regionally and have varying literacy across the Home Island. For example, [*Upotenne*](/docs/MillMint/Vekllei/language/#25-upotenne) is employed frequently in rural and agrarian communities, where religious ritual requires its frequent practice. This passage introduces the broad characteristics of each sub-language, which together form contemporary Vekllei, one of the world's most complex and hermetic language systems.

### 2.1 Spoken Vekllei

Spoken Vekllei, simply referred to as Vekllei domestically, is the common spoken language of Vekllei and official language of the country.

#### 2.2.1 Overview

Contemporary spoken Vekllei is largely descended from *Proto-Icelandic* speech that arrived with the first Danish settlers in the country, but includes *Kalaallisut* and *Proto-Algic* reconstructions of an early extinct language called *Kala*.

#### 2.2.2 Twin Glossaries

Spoken Vekllei draws from two glossaries, called *Oa* and *Loh*. These glossaries date back to twin reconstructed Algic-Aleutian languages called *Topyas* and the Indo-European *Icelandic* that had been present in earlier forms since at least 1200BC. The glossaries were formalised in pagan ritual that would become present-day [*Upen*](docs/millmint/vekllei/religion.md), and later recognised at the official language of the country in the reformation of language initiated by Queen Souisviasn in the 3rd century.

- ##### Oa (*lit.* Sun)
  *Oa* is considered to have 'permanent' traits. It is often characterised abroad as a positive glossary, though this is not true -- it is in fact dedicated to inanimate and unliving organs. It is gendered as masculine, and is associated with Summer and Spring.
- ##### Loh (*lit.* Moon)
  *Loh* is considered to have 'cyclical' traits. Loh words are largely derived from Old Vekllei (including Icelandic), and so its glossary is considerably less defined and dependent on older linguistic artefacts. *Loh* words
 It is gendered as feminine, and is associated with winter and autumn.

#### 2.2.3 Pronunciation

Spoken Vekllei is phonologically homogenous, and has little variation in accent or pronunciation across the Home Island or its various possessions.
