## What is this project?

<blockquote><i>So this is Utopia,<br />
Is it? Well — <br />
I beg your pardon;<br />
I thought it was Hell.</i></blockquote>

-- Max Beerbohm[^1]

<span class="fc">I</span>
**work with utopia**. This is what I do; this is what I love doing. It's a dream that makes me feel good, that's all. My name is Hobart, and I think about my perfect place for a living, called [*Vekllei*](/utopia/vekllei/). It's part-escapism, part-fantasy, and all good.

Vekllei is a jumble of very pure, obsessive instincts that are illustrated in such a way that, for a moment, they should feel possible, or immersive. Vekllei does not use any money -- a fantastical concept. But I can't concede and offer an alternative currency in its place, because that would ruin a very nice and pure idea. You should not have to search your pockets for a labour-voucher or ration card when you go to a cinema or café. You should walk right in. Take this idea and stretch it to the size of a country, and you have Vekllei.

I have built a very complicated society to justify the pure idea, and populated it with unusual people filled with the good and bad things of me and people I admire. That's worth keeping in mind, I think. That everything you read is a justification of simple, good things.

1. This place is **iterative** -- canon disappears, people change appearance and the systems of Vekllei twist and turn as I do.
2. This place is **good-spirited** -- Vekllei is escapism, and although the dark accompanies the light, this project is supposed to be calming and fun.
3. This place is **constantly expanding** -- I try out new styles, mediums and methods of distribution all the time. Some of them work, some of them don't. That's part of the fun of it!

## Three Utopias

> *I define the broad, general phenomenon of utopianism as social dreaming -- the dreams and nightmares that concern the ways in which groups of people arrange their lives and which usually envision a radically different society than the one in which the dreamers live. But not all are radical, for some people at any time dream of something basically familiar.*

-- Lyman Sargent[^2]

I think of Vekllei as three parts. Each part is utopian, in the sense that it's a dream of some kind, but they're not quite the same. If places can be utopian, why not lived experience and people? To keep things clear, I arrange my regular [posts](/posts/) into three parts.

{{< details title="Project Fact Sheet" open=true >}}
1. **Utopia as Landscape** -- the country of Vekllei, with its geography, architecture, aesthetics, society, and culture.
2. **Utopia as Character** -- the people of Vekllei, as they represent, interrogate, and soothe aspects of myself and others.
3. **Utopia as Author** -- me, and my motivations, failings, and journey as a storyteller and illustrator.

## Futher Reading

If you're curious what sort of things go into a place like Vekllei, these are some of my favourite books. I've been asked about them before, so I've included this section in the hopes you enjoy them as much as I have. There are many more than these, so if you're interested, [contact me](/newsdesk/about). I'll update this list periodically as more occur to me.

### On the Origins of Modern Japanese Literature
**Karatani Kojin** | 1993

Karatani interrogates the appearance of Western conceptual artefacts (Landscape, The Child, Interiority) during the Meiji period in Japan. This book had a tremendous impact on my assumptions about the world and affected Vekllei tremendously.

### Starting Point *&* Turning Point
**Miyazaki Hayao** | 2009 & 2014

These books are essentially a compilation of essays from Miyazaki's years as a filmmaker. He's an incredibly smart and insightful creative force whose work [I have written at length about](/newsdesk/essays/ghibli) before. For me, it's all really powerful, affecting stuff.

### Three Faces of Utopianism Revisited
**Lyman Sargent** | 1994

This is the defining taxonomical look at the phenomena of utopianism and how it works. His breakdown of 'utopia' into both dystopian and eutopian elements is also my preffered descriptor and use of 'utopia' as a concept.

### Towards a New Architecture
**Le Corbusier** | 1936

Vekllei is a postmodern mess, but also deeply sympathetic to the modernist instinct. I like the utopianism of the 20th Century, and Le Corbusier typifies that 'utopian' futurism we saw in that period. I like how single-minded he is about it. His buildings remain beautiful, many years on.
