## Quick Facts

* **Vekllei is a utopia**, but that doesn't mean I don't take it seriously or consider its society pragmatically.
* **It's full of stuff I love**, but that doesn't mean it's perfect. Personal growth can come from bad experiences.
* **I draw in certain styles**, but Vekllei isn't based off any one country.
* **Vekllei is mostly self-contained stories**, but I experiment with mediums and methods all the time.

## F.A.Q.

#### Who are you?

[A Tasmanian illustrator.](/newsdesk/about/)

#### You’re not Japanese?

お前はもう死んでいる

#### Why is Vekllei a utopia?

It makes me feel better about my life and the world. It’s escapism; it’s a dream.

#### It’s a bit cringe to grandstand your political beliefs, doncha think?

Vekllei is a personal utopia. That’s what I’m selling. At least you’re getting good opinions.

#### Where’s the tension if it’s perfect?

Vekllei is very cynical and tragic in places. Utopia is just a reflection of the author, good and bad.

#### Is there a novel? A story? A comic?

I’m working on a comic right now. I’m pretty much working on Vekllei full-time so I’m hoping to announce it soon. I’ve got a lot of different Vekllei projects going.

#### Where is Vekllei?

Iceland.

#### Why does Vekllei look Japanese?

Vekllei is like a country of Scandinavians speaking French with an Aussie accent in Shōwa era Japan/Maoist China/Taiwan etc. Vekllei looks however I imagine utopia looks.

#### How does that make sense?

Why can’t it just be cool?

#### Is your alt-history thought out?

Vekllei’s history is whatever I need it to be. I’m always trying to be realistic, but it’s all worked backwards from the setting. I’m not really “worldbuilding” in a typical sense. Very little of it is published, most of it is retrieved on request. Just ask if you have questions.

#### Why does Vekllei call itself “petticoat socialist”?

Vekllei is set in a culture of Marxist revivalism in the 50s and 60s. A lot of Vekllei’s lexicon is set in that context. Vekllei is a decentralised democracy that doesn’t use money. It’s a sort of participatory economy. It's almost anarchic in that sense.

#### Why the "petticoat"?

Vekllei is a female country. Womanhood is decommodified. It's maternal, social and friendly where progressive utopian rhetoric is masculine, technocratic and historicist.

#### Who is Zelda?

Zelda is another name for Tzipora. She has two names specifically to confuse you.
