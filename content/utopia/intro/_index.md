## What is this project?

<blockquote><i>So this is Utopia,<br />
Is it? Well — <br />
I beg your pardon;<br />
I thought it was Hell.</i></blockquote>

-- Max Beerbohm[^1]

**y stories are about good places and people**. That's the gist of it. [Vekllei](/utopia/vekllei/) is a fictional country where I demonstrate good things by drawing and writing about them. It's part-escapism, part-fantasy, and all good. 

This website is a comprehensive archive and portal to everything I do. 

* **Utopia** is for everything related to Vekllei, its world, and characters
* **Newsdesk** is for everything outside of it
* **Posts** is for the individual stories I write and draw regularly.

Vekllei is a jumble of very pure, obsessive instincts that are illustrated to make them look and feel real. I want to take purity seriously by considering its implications in the real world. Vekllei does not use money -- a very straightforward and fantastical idea. Of course, moneylessness has extraordinary implications, and to maintain the purity of the idea we have to work very hard.

Simplicity is actually very complicated, and so Vekllei is very complicated to justify the simplicity. It's filled with things I value and people I admire. You'll find hundreds of posts and many articles on this site, and all of them are designed to make this place and its people feel real.

Just a few things to keep in mind:

* This place is **iterative** -- canon disappears, people change appearance and the systems of Vekllei twist and turn as I do.
* This place is **good-spirited** -- Vekllei is escapism, and although the dark accompanies the light, this project is supposed to be escapist and fun.
* This place is **constantly expanding** -- I try out new styles, mediums and methods of distribution all the time. Some of them work, some of them don't. That's part of the fun of it!

## Three Utopias

{{< hint red >}}

> *I define the broad, general phenomenon of utopianism as social dreaming -- the dreams and nightmares that concern the ways in which groups of people arrange their lives and which usually envision a radically different society than the one in which the dreamers live. But not all are radical, for some people at any time dream of something basically familiar.*

-- Lyman Sargent[^2]

This project has three parts. Each part is a little utopia, in the sense that it's a dream of some kind, but they're not quite the same.

1. **Utopia as Landscape** -- the country of Vekllei, with its geography, architecture, aesthetics, society, and culture.
2. **Utopia as Character** -- the people of Vekllei, as they represent, interrogate, and soothe aspects of myself and others.
3. **Utopia as Author** -- me, and my motivations, failings, and journey as a storyteller and illustrator.

If you're curious what sort of things go into a place like Vekllei, these are some of my favourite books. I've been asked about them before, so I've included this section in the hopes you enjoy them as much as I have. There are many more than these, so if you're interested, [contact me](/newsdesk/about). I'll update this list periodically as more occur to me.

### On the Origins of Modern Japanese Literature
**Karatani Kojin** | 1993

Karatani interrogates the appearance of Western conceptual artefacts (Landscape, The Child, Interiority) during the Meiji period in Japan. This book had a tremendous impact on my assumptions about the world and affected Vekllei tremendously.

### Starting Point *&* Turning Point
**Miyazaki Hayao** | 2009 & 2014

These books are essentially a compilation of essays from Miyazaki's years as a filmmaker. He's an incredibly smart and insightful creative force whose work [I have written at length about](/newsdesk/essays/ghibli) before. For me, it's all really powerful, affecting stuff.

### Three Faces of Utopianism Revisited
**Lyman Sargent** | 1994

This is the defining taxonomical look at the phenomena of utopianism and how it works. His breakdown of 'utopia' into both dystopian and eutopian elements is also my preffered descriptor and use of 'utopia' as a concept.

### Towards a New Architecture
**Le Corbusier** | 1936

Vekllei is a postmodern mess, but also deeply sympathetic to the modernist instinct. I like the utopianism of the 20th Century, and Le Corbusier typifies that 'utopian' futurism we saw in that period. I like how single-minded he is about it. His buildings remain beautiful, many years on.
