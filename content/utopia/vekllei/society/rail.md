## Overview

{{< hint panel >}}
***This article*** *discusses one of the most important and visible organisations in everyday Vekllei life: Vekllei National Rail. Vekllei is criss-crossed by hundreds of different rail lines of various gauges, grades, and purposes. In fact, it runs many lines at a total loss, often undercapacity. To understand these inefficiencies is to understand why the National Rail exists, and to some extent, how Vekllei's state assets and powerful bureaus shape life in the country today.*

<span class="fc">T</span>
**he National Rail of Vekllei** is a catch-all term for bureau-backed, state-owned rail operators of Vekllei. In casual use, it refers to the Vekllei National Railway A.r.R. and its sister companies, like Vekllei Metro, which are structured within the service-oriented Railways Bureau. More precisely, Vekllei National Rail encompasses several different bureaus that operate, design, maintain and communicate rail service in the country, which itself is further included under the Transport Requisite of the Vekllei Government.

Like most critical organisations of Vekllei, the structure and directorship of Vekllei National Rail is complex, but can be simplified by understanding that all rail transport in the country is ultimately the responsibility of an organisation called Vekllei National Rail, and it is towards this organ that this article is addressed. Today, the National Rail operates nearly 20,000km of track, indicating the density of the rail service it provides, and services nearly 20 million people each day through its network.


### Introduction

Since nationalisation of the private Vekllei rail companies in 1925, the structure and reach of Vekllei National Rail has changed several times. Operated as a for-profit enterprise, with the understanding it will always run at a loss, the National Rail's history of expansion is reflected in the variety of trains and track gauges it maintains.

Vekllei is highly unusual in the density of its rail, a feature of the collision of postwar city planning and the Home Island's history as an industrial port city-state. Very few Vekllei people own automobiles, and rail planning considers 



Unusually, Vekllei National Rail is legally absolved of all non-rail transport, and possesses no busses or ferries for public use, which are operated and maintained by dedicated adjacent bureaus.

### History

Although Vekllei has used wagonways since the 17th Century and developed horse-drawn railways for industrial transport in its ports, the first passenger rail line in Vekllei was founded in 1855 by the Pharos Rail Company. 

The history of rail in Vekllei can be summarised in three key eras of development.

>* **Early Development and expansion**, from early service in 1855.
>* **Late Junta/Prewar nationalisation**, from nationalisation in 1925.
>* **Postwar refounding and development**, since independence in 2015.

#### Early Development

#### Nationalisation

#### Postwar Development

### Structure

Vekllei National Rail is part of the Transport Requisite of the Vekllei Government (A.r.R., or *requoisesiasn amourisocietie resmesnghet*) as several individual state requisite bureaus, which in turn amalgamate different transport companies. Although its structure in Vekllei might be analogous to a government ministry abroad, it functions in practice more like a state-owned enterprise with many subsidiaries. It is not a state-run corporation, and maintains seperate accounting.

Vekllei National Rail is administered through three State Requisites: the Vekllei National Rail itself including all regular operations and rail service, the National Rail Insurance Scheme which finances construction through Government White Bonds, and the Rail Safety Commission.

## Service

{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint panel >}}
**The Royal Mail** maintains a constitutionally-bound monopoly on all postage in the country, leaving it the sole provider of universal postage service in Vekllei. Like most State Requisites (A.r.), however, it has substantial international trade and foreign dealings that provide for its common description as a state-owned for-profit enterprise, or public corporation.
{{< /hint >}}

<span class="fc">U</span>
**niversal service** is, by the glossary of the Mail, truly universal. As mandated by Vekllei law, the Mail provides delivery for all postage material anywhere in the world, or indeed, beyond it. It maintains 6,424 post offices across Vekllei, including its antarctic and peripheral possessions. The Mail's first Lunar Post Office opened in 2059. In addition to its domestic monopoly, the Mail contributes nearly VK❦2.6 trillion each year towards the Vekllei Government Securities Bureau (the country's sovereign wealth fund) through its international postage and courier services abroad, under the name World Post.

Since the Mail's Office of Telecommunications is also responsible for all telephones, telegrams and videophones in the country, the Mail's status as a lynchpin of communication is absolute, and heavily protected by the postwar Vekllei constitution.

### National Rail

{{< /hint >}}

The Mail aims to provide next-day delivery during weekdays in zero-code (that is to say, *Home Island*) regions. Overnight delivery is also generally available between *Home Islands*, *Aismious* Islands, *Kala* and the *Azores* during weekdays. Most Lunar territories are available on Mondays and Fridays, and other territories are available according to the Mail's region table.

Although Vekllei people do not pay to post items, stamps are affixed with coloured squares called *chromacodes* which are used in the automatic sorting machines common in the country. International Mail uses traditional stamps with price listed, and the Vekllei Crown displayed. Franking is used for tracking and identification.

### Metropolitan Service & Subways

Special, commercial and industrial postage is managed within the **Postal Service Bureau** through special sorting facilities and a dedicated postal network. Regular business postage is funnelled through regular daily service, but hazardous, oversized and dangerous goods are accepted by special Post Offices designed to accept them. The Mail does not provide special services for regular residential or courier delivery.

### Tramways

The Mail is best known overseas as the **World Post**, which offers services for foreign clients and has established itself as one of the Big Four international transnational courier services in the world today. Similar to domestic postal systems in other countries, the World Post offers flat rates for delivery anywhere in the world, priced according to size and weight. In addition, sister company **Universal Express** offers next-day weekday delivery in certain markets. Most employees of the World Post and Universal Express are foreign workers banking labour-hours for immigration to Vekllei. Unlike domestic service, the World Post and Universal Express use private courier contracts extensively to fulfil orders.

### Freight

The **Labour Bank of Vekllei**[^2] is easily accessible via the Mail's **Financial Services Bureau**. Although inaccessible within the country, savings can be withdrawn conditionally upon emigration, and the Mail offers easy access and financial counselling for Vekllei people. Through the Financial Services Bureau, the Mail also offers financial management to immigrant populations with wealth transfer (the phrase for banking of savings and prior income) and Overseas Accounting, commonly used to send money to family abroad.

### Telecommunications

**Cosma** (a portmanteau of *communicasia matismion*) is Vekllei's state communications company, responsible for all residential and public telephones in the country. This includes videophones, public phone booths, and residential networks. Cosma also maintains telecommunications infrastructure networks internationally through **Cosma Overseas**, primarily the Vekllei-Europe undersea cables and their sister sets between Vekllei and North America. Much of the network dates back over a hundred years, since a shortage of modern personal telephones in Vekllei requires Cosma to maintain a wide variety of voltage and cable standards. Commercial, industrial and government telecommunications is managed by a seperate internal department called the **Industrial Telecommunications Office**.

**As a military organ**, the Mail A.r. retains military ranks for its staff, commanded by a Postmaster General and aided by a civilian regulator designed to keep its critical service available to Vekllei people. The Mail's fleet includes dedicated jets, automatic trucks, mail trains, intercity pneumatic systems, vehicle automen, and postmen, all wearing the red and gold colours of the organisation. In total, the Mail delivers nearly 50 million pieces of mail during weekdays.
{{< /hint >}}

<span class="fc">I</span>
**t is evident** that the services assigned to the Mail by the postwar constitution are of critical importance to the stability of Vekllei society. In addition to being one of the oldest active postal organisations in the world, the Royal Mail of Vekllei is tremendously busy, since physical post has scarcely been displaced by the telephone in the country. Even without the Mail's international postage, domestic mail each day can exceed 12 million pieces -- enough for 1 in 2 people, though commercial mail and periodicals are included.

As is typical for critical bureaus in Vekllei, the Mail alleviates the stress of daily service through its dense, vertically-integrated infrastructure aided by automatic (automen vehicles) and permanent fixtures (pneumatic systems and automatic sorting/franking machines). It is precisely this commitment to infrastructure that makes the Mail so visible in daily life, and contributes to its ongoing legacy as Vekllei's oldest running government institution.

### Staff
{{<columns>}}
![img](/images/mail.jpg)
<--->
![img](/images/postmistress.jpg)
{{</columns>}}

The Mail employs 48,960 people full-time across its various offices, and nearly 200,000 automen in various roles. Although the Mail does retain a staff of postmen and couriers, most urban daily service is now provided by automatic vehicles and sorting, which account for nearly half of the total automen owned by the organisation. Instead, the majority of Mail employees are involved in the running of the organisation -- mostly as clerks, managers, and administrators. Around 10,000 postmen are employed by the Mail in daily delivery, called "posties". There are around 8,000 postal routes in the country.

Although at first glance the number of automen dramatically exceeds demand, the total count is misleading -- most automen with the Mail are integrated into the infrastructure of its sorting centres and post offices, and very few are traditionally autonomous robots commonly seen in public in Vekllei. Only about 8,000 automen are employed in physical mail delivery.

There are 16,220 post boxes in Vekllei, which are iconic for their red and gold paint and intricate detailing.

### Fleet

{{< hint orange >}}

{{< /hint >}}

The Mail retains a large and diverse fleet of vehicles in regular operations, which, due to their diversity and and expense, have become iconic around the world. From bicycles to space planes, the Mail's fleet of vehicles rivals in diversity postal services three times its size, largely benefitted by Vekllei's obfuscated budgeting system and cultural importance afforded to the organisation.

 The following table lists company vehicles relevant to regular postal service.

## Notes

[^1]: *A.r.* is a shortening of *state requisite* (A.r., or requoisesiasn amourisocietie)

[^2]: The *Labour Bank of Vekllei* (often called the *Government Bank*) is Vekllei's social bank, and each Vekllei person is entitled to an equal share of it.
