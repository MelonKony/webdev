>She never claimed to be like the boys at Yana, because she wasnâ€™t. But she knew what it was like to enter domesticity and never feel at home in it. She was lucky; she had Baron. She wondered about those boys who married before they left. She wondered where those brides were now.

**he borough of Yana** is a borough in Central Vekllei, located in the far-western Lava region north of Tiyousn and east of Laisiyo. It is named after Yana, a city of some 45,000 people isolated along Vekllei's sparse, moonlike volcanic interior for which the Lava region is named. Yana makes up part of an agro-belt of depopulated boroughs that sit along the Sesmiousvianneh river, which washes rich igneous minerals north to towns downstream. The town of Yana is best known for its proximity to the spectacular molten lava fields common in the area.

## Etymology

**Yana** was the name of Vekllei's first spirit ambassador in [Upen](/utopia/vekllei/culture/religion/) mythology, who met human farmer Armond Volusksson at the base of *Mose*, a volcano associated with lava spirits. Although the meeting (as described in the *Molten Wind* sagas) took place in the present-day borough of Askayaisn, it remains a common Blood Name in the country and was chosen for Yana's settlement to protect it against seismic activity.

## History

Artefacts recovered from north of the town of Aya in Bakur date to nearly 1000BC, approaching earliest estimates of known settlement in the Vekllei Home Islands. Bakur's first residents were likely nomadic arctic peoples immigrating from nearby Kala (Greenland) looking for hunting grounds in winter. Sagas confirm the town of Bakur was established in the 14th Century AD to support the creation of an arctic naval fort, but the fort was abandoned less than a hundred years later and few residents remained, leaving Bakur mostly abandoned until the early 19th Century, when it was reestablished as a base of operations for Vekllei's colonial whaling fleet. Today it remains a shrinking fishing town, bolstered only by seasonal workers imported by the Ocean Office.

The town is the birthplace of celebrated Vekllei folk songwriter Tohs Viskaismesn (1847-1912).

### 2006 Flood Disaster

In May 2006, heavy rains over the *Skusme* glacier caused the Sesmiousvianneh river to swell over its banks and flooded the town of Yana, washing away several homes and a mill. Nearly 150 people died as their homes were swept away, making it the largest flooding disaster in recent Vekllei memory.

## Geography

The Bakur borough is home to some of Vekllei's most spectacular subarctic scenery, dominated lava slopes, ice fields, and fjords. Its position among the Westernmost boroughs in Vekllei makes it a great staging town for Vekllei's expansive fishing fleet, including line and trawling vessels.
